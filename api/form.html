Working with form data
<h2>Working with form data in mod_lua</h2>

<p>
Like most other web frameworks, mod_lua distinguishes between <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> data. 
The method for obtaining these two sets of data are different, but the result is the same. Let's start by 
looking at how to obtain GET data using <a href="/api/builtin#parseargs">r:parseargs</a>:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;!-- foo.html --&gt;
&lt;form action="foo.lua" method="GET"&gt;
    &lt;b>Your name:&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="name" size="20"/&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Send request" /&gt;
&lt;/form>
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lua">
-- foo.lua:
function handle(r)
    local GET = r:parseargs() -- parse the GET data and return it as key/value pairs.
    local myName = GET['name'] or "Anonymous" -- Get the 'name' variable, or fall back to 'Anonymous'.
    r:puts( ("Hello, %s!"):format(myName) ) -- Say something to the browser
    return apache2.OK
end
</pre>

<p>If you had entered <code>John Doe</code> as the name in the box and clicked on the submit button, you would then 
be presented with the text <code>Hello, John Doe!</code>. So far so good!
</p>

<h3>Dealing with multiple values for each key</h3>

<p>But what if you had two identical fields? Odd as it may be, it's not uncommon, as you may, for instance have several 
check boxes with the same name (for instance, when a user has to pick 3 different options in a group of 20), and with 
the generic approach, only one of those values would make it to the GET table in mod_lua. To accommodate this, mod_lua
returns <strong>two</strong> tables instead of one; One with regular key/value pairs for single key, single value elements,
and one where each value is in fact a list of all the values that the key/value pair has. As such, you can request the URL
<code>http://mydomain.tld/foo.lua?name=John&name=Foo&name=Bar</code> and have all three values available to you:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lua">
function handle(r)
    local GET, GETMULTI = r:parseargs() -- Get the regular and the special table
    local myName = GET['name'] or 'Anonymous' -- What we did before
    -- Do we have more than one value assigned for the 'name' key?
    if GETMULTI['name'] and #GETMULTI['name'] > 1 then
        myName = table.concat(GETMULTI['name'], ", ") -- concat names together
    end
    r:puts( ("Hello, %s!"):format(myName) ) -- Say something to the browser
    return apache2.OK
end
</pre>

<p>If we visited the above mentioned URL with the old script, we would be greeted with: <code>Welcome, Bar!</code>.
If we use the new code, we would now be greeted with: <code>Welcome, John, Foo, Bar!</code> instead. Easy peasy.
</p>

<h3>Dealing with POST data</h3>
<p>Dealing with POST data is similar to dealing with GET data, except it requires a different call to mod_lua;
namely a call to <a href="/api/builtin#parsebody">r:parsebody</a>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lua">
function handle(r)
    local POST, POSTMULTI = r:parsebody() -- Get the regular and the special table from POST data.
    local myName = POST['name'] or 'Anonymous' -- What we did before
    -- Do we have more than one value assigned for the 'name' key?
    if POSTMULTI['name'] and #POSTMULTI['name'] > 1 then
        myName = table.concat(POSTMULTI['name'], ", ") -- concat names together
    end
    r:puts( ("Hello, %s!"):format(myName) ) -- Say something to the browser
    return apache2.OK
end
</pre>

<p>r:parsebody is different in that accepts an optional parameter in the call, limiting the amount of POST data that
will be parsed. This value has a default of 8KB, and if the limit is exceeded, the POST data will simply be ignored.
This prevents having to waste CPU cycles parsing, for instance, 1GB of POST data when we know that no form would ever
contain that much data, or it can be used to limit the size of uploaded files and so on:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lua">
function handle(r)
    local POST = r:parsebody(1024*1024) -- Only parse up to 1MB of data
    if POST['foo'] then
        r:puts("You entered the 'foo' value!")
    else
        r:puts("Please enter a value for 'foo' and keep it below 1MB!")
    end
    return apache2.OK
end
</pre>

<h3>Dealing with raw data (for instance PUT requests)</h3>
<p>If you want to just grab all the data that has been sent, without parsing it first, there is a function for that as well,
called <a href="/api/builtin#requestbody">r:requestbody</a>. It can return the uploaded data as a string, or save the contents
to a local file:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lua">
function handle(r)
    local data
    local bytes = 0
    -- option one
    if load_into_memory then
        data = r:requestbody() -- Get the entire request body and store it in memory
        bytes = data:len()
        
    -- option two
    else
        r:requestbody("/tmp/foo.data") -- Save the uploaded data in a file instead
        local info = r:stat("/tmp/foo.data") -- get file info
        bytes = info.size
    end        
    r:puts( ("You submitted %u bytes of data to us."):format(bytes) )
    return apache2.OK
end
</pre>
