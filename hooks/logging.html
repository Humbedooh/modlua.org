Logging
<h2>Hooking into the logging phase with mod_lua</h2>

<p>
    The logging phase that mod_lua has access to is quite simple. When you use the <code>LuaHookLog</code> directive,
    you can hook into the logging phase very early and either change the parameters of the request before logging occurs,
    or you can opt to write to your own mod_lua log file thingy and omit the record from the 'official' log files.
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at how you would create a custom handler that checks and omits certain requests from the log files:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-config">
#httpd.conf:
LuaHookLog /etc/lua/scripts/logging.lua log_handler
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lua">
-- logging.lua:
function log_handler(r)
    if r.uri:match("/secret_area/") then
        return apache2.DONE -- skip the actual logging, this is secret!
    else
        return apache2.DECLINED -- pass the buck to the other logging handlers
    end
end
</pre>
