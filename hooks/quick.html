Quick Handler hooks
<h2>Quick Handler hooks in mod_lua</h2>

<p>
    The quick handling phase begins right after the request has been parsed, and before all the other phases.
    The purpose of this phase is to quickly assess a request and act before we do all the translation, mapping, fixing,
    handling, logging et cetera.
</p>

<p>
    The use cases for this phase are plenty: We can use it to quickly deny access to a resource without having to
    go through all the other phases, or we can use it to quickly give a reply and exit the request without having
    to translate, map or log the request, thus speeding things up:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-config">
LuaQuickHandler /etc/lua/scripts/quickhandler.lua quick
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lua">
-- quickhandler.lua:

function quick(r)
    -- If the user requests, for instance, http://mydomain.tld/, then we'll just handle it here and skip everything else
    if r.uri == "/" then
        r.content_type = "text/html"
        r:puts("Hello, world!")
        return apache2.DONE -- DONE really means "we're done, skip everything else, even logging"
    else
        return apache2.DECLINED -- DECLINED here means "we did't handle this, continue with the other phases"
    end
end
</pre>

<p>
    Another, more useful approach is a security module that checks how frequently a client has requested a resource,
    and if, for example, it was less than a second ago since the last request, we deny a new one for now:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-config">
LuaQuickHandler /etc/lua/scripts/quickhandler.lua accesscheck
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lua">
-- quickhandler.lua:

function accesscheck(r)
    local now = r.clock() -- Get the current time with microsec precision
    local ip = r.useragent_ip -- fetch the client's IP
    local last = r:ivm_get("last_" .. ip) -- Get the last access time of this client from global storage
    local okay = true
    if last then
        if (now - last) < 1 then
            okay = false
        end
    end
    r:ivm_set("last_" .. ip, now) -- Update the record of when the last access was
    
    -- Is the client allowed to acccess already, or do we deny?
    if not okay then
        r.content_type = "text/plain"
        r:write("Too many requests per second, please go have a cup of coffee!")
        return apache2.DONE -- We're done with this, ignore the other phases
    else
        return apache2.DECLINED -- The client is allowed to continue, we're not handling this
    end
end
</pre>
