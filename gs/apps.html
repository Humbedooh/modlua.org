Getting started with web apps
<h2>Getting started with web apps</h2>
<p>
    To get started with writing web apps (think PHP, ASP etc), you'll need to tell httpd to regard
    your scripts as Lua scripts. If we assume that your scripts all end with <code>.lua</code>, then you'll need
    to add the following to your appropriate VirtualHost or global section:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-config">
    &lt;Files *.lua&gt;
        SetHandler lua-script
    &lt;/Files&gt;
</pre>

<p>
    This will tell httpd, that all of your .lua files will be treated as Lua scripts, and run through mod_lua.
    The standard procedure for creating a new Lua script is to make a function called <code>handle</code>, which
    gets passed a <a href="/api/request">request_rec</a> structure with all of mod_lua's internal variables and
    <a href="/api/builtin">built-in functions</a>, and expects one of several return codes.
    A boilerplate web app, which sets a content type and prints out something, could look like this:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lua">
function handle(r)
    r.content_type = "text/html" -- set the output to text/html
    r:puts("Hello world!")
    return apache2.OK
end
</pre>

<p>The return code, <code>apache2.OK</code> basically means "everything went okay, carry on". If you wish to return a specific
HTTP status, you may do so by returning the integer value of that code, such as 404 for <code>Not found</code> or a 500 for <code>Internal Server Error</code>.</p>

<p>
    The entire Lua script will be parsed before the function is run, and as such, it is recommended that you include any external
    libraries in the global scope:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-lua">
local foo = require "foo"
function handle(r)
    r.content_type = "text/html" -- set the output to text/html
    local form = r:parseargs() -- get some GET data
    local name = form['name'] or "Anonymous"
    r:puts("Hello ", name, "!")
    return apache2.OK
end
</pre>
