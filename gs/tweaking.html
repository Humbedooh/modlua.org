Tweaking mod_lua
<h2>Tweaking mod_lua</h2>
<p>
    mod_lua has some particular directives that affect memory and cpu consumption, most notably the <code>LuaScope</code>
    directive, which controls the creation and destruction of VMs (Virtual Machines). Each hook or web application has its own VM,
    separated from other scripts, created by default when a script is requested through a URL, either as a hook or as a web app,
    and destroyed when the request is done. The LuaScope directive allows you to control and tweak the creation of VMs, more specifically
    the option of retaining a VM, reusing it on the next request, thus saving the time and energy normally spent on creating and destroying
    a VM, at the cost of increased memory usage. In most cases, this extra memory usage is negligible, as Lua's garbage collector is quite
    good at its job. If your programming skills are sane, and you don't create any (deliberate) memory leaks, you can gain upwards of a 120%
    increase in page speed by changing the scope of the Lua VMs.
</p>

<h3>Setting the right scope</h3>
<p>
    The default scope, as said, is the <code>request</code> scope, which means that a VM will be created for your script when a request
    is initiated, and destroyed when the request is done. For pure testing of various 'unsafe' scripts, this is a good default setting,
    albeit a slightly slow one. If you are confident in your programming skills, or if you are on a production machine with plenty of RAM
    and slightly starved of CPU, setting this directive to use the <code>thread</code> or <code>server</code> scope will cause VMs to
    be reused by new requests, thus removing the time it takes to spin up a new VM on each request. Your scripts will still have an isolated
    VM, but it will persist through requests, retaining the data accumulated in previous runs (unless the GC collects it, of course).
</p>

<p>
    The following LuaScope settings are available:
</p>

<table class="table table-striped">
    <tr><th style="width: 80px;">Scope:</th><th>Description:</th></tr>
    <tr><td><code>once</code></td><td>The VM will be used only once and then destroyed, even if the script is run several times in a request.
                                        This is the slowest of all settings, performance wise</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>request</code></td><td>The VM will be used for the lifetime of a single request.
                                            If the script is called several times during that request, the VM will be reused, and then destroyed
                                            when the request is done. This is the default setting</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>conn</code></td><td>The VM will be used for the entirity of a connection. If keepalive is in use, then several requests can be made
                                        within the same VM. This has a moderate performance gain.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>thread</code></td><td>The VM will persist through the lifetime of the processing thread. This will cause a higher memory usage, as
                                        multiple inactive VMs may be present if you have a lot of different scripts configured/available, but
                                        is by far the fastest of all options. If you have plenty of RAM (think Megabytes, not Gigabytes), this
                                        is the preferred option to use.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>server</code></td><td>This option is a pragmatic approach, in which the process itself keeps a pool of VMs that threads can
                                            acquire, use and release when they are done using them. It has roughly the same speed as the <code>thread</code>
                                            scope setting, but uses less memory, as you can configure a pool smaller than the number of threads.
                                            It requires a <code>min</code> and a <code>max</code> setting, which should be lower than the number of
                                            threads per process.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Some example scopes:</h3>

<p>
    
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-config">
# Create and throw away the VM on each access to a script:
LuaScope once

# Use a thread scope for optimal performance
LuaScope thread

# Use a server pool of VMs. We have 100 threads per process, so let's set the pool to 20.
# This will use at most 20% the memory the 'thread' scope would use.
# 5 20 means "create 5 VMs to start with, and increase to a maximum of 20 IF NEEDED"
LuaScope server 5 20
</pre>

<h3>Managing memory consumption with the server/thread scope</h3>

<p>
    It may prudent to consider that no matter how well you program, you may end up causing a memory leak.
    If you are using the <code>thread</code> or <code>server</code> scope for optimal speeds, you should consider
    setting the <code><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mpm_common.html#maxconnectionsperchild">MaxConnectionsPerChild</a></code>
    directive to a sensible value. This directive will cause a server process to shut down and restart once it has hit a specific
    number of requests, allowing any memory leaks to be cleaned up. Users of mod_php will probably have happened upon this directive,
    as it is quite crucial when using mod_php. With mod_lua, it is not as crucial, as memory consumption is considerably lower, but
    nonetheless, it is a good idea to set this directive to a value above zero, to ensure that <em>should there be a leak</em>, it
    will be taken care of:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-config">
# Set the process to 'reboot' after having received 50,000 requests
MaxConnectionsPerChild 50000
</pre>

<h2>Code caching</h2>

<p>
    By default, mod_lua will cache scripts in memory for the entirity of a VM. If you have your VM scope set to <kbd>server</kbd> or <kbd>thread</kbd>,
    this will cause scripts not to update if you change them while httpd is running. This is okay on a production web server,
    but if you regularly update your scripts on your dev server, you will need to tell mod_lua to reload scripts when they have changed.
</p>

<p>
    The reloading of scripts is configured through the <code>LuaCodeCache</code> directive. The following options are available:
</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
    <tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td><code>never</code></td><td>Never cache scripts, always reload them when accessed. This is a slow performance setting, but may be needed on NFS mounted systems</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>always</code></td><td>Always cache scripts forever, never reload them. This is mainly for production web servers where your scrips never change</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>stat</code></td><td>This is the optimal setting for a development system. It will run a <kbd>stat()</kbd> call on the script, and if it has changed, it will reload the script.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
    Examples:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-config">
# Tell httpd to check if the script has updated upon access
LuaCodeCache stat

# Tell httpd to cache scripts forever
LuaCodeCache always

# OR, tell httpd to never cache scripts:
LuaCodeCache never
</pre>

<p>
    If you are only using mod_lua for web apps, the <kbd>stat</kbd> setting is preferred, as httpd will run a stat on the file nonetheless, and mod_lua
    uses this stat information, speeding up performance a bit.
