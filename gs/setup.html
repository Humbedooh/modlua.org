Setting up mod_lua
<h2>Setting up mod_lua</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to a very small document! It is entirely on purpose. This document assumes you have
    already installed and enabled mod_lua. If you haven't done so yet, <a href="/gs/installing">Click here</a>
    to read about how you do that.
</p>

<p>
    Setting up mod_lua doesn't require a whole lot of work, in fact it pretty much runs out of the box.
    If all you wish is to run .lua scripts as web applications, then you need only follow the steps
    outlined in the "<a href="/gs/apps">Getting started with web apps</a>" document and you're all set.
    If you are interested in working with hooks, follow the guide in "<a href="/gs/hooks">Getting started
    with hooks</a>" document. For filters, check out the "<a href="/filters/intro">Filters introduction</a>".
</p>

<p>
    You may want to check out the "<a href="/gs/tweaking">Tweaking mod_lua</a>" document to see how to
    increase the performance of mod_lua, as well as learn about some considerations to make when
    using mod_lua for hooks or web apps.

<h3>Setting the root of all Lua scripts used in hooks/filters</h3>
<p>
    If all your scripts for hooks/filters are placed in the same folder - let's say <kbd>/etc/lua/scripts</kbd> -
    then you can avoid having to type the full url every time you configure a hook/filter by using the
    <code>LuaScope</code> directive. This directive sets the root path from which all LuaHook* directives
    are evaluated. Consider the following:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-config">
LuaHookTranslateName /etc/lua/scripts/translate.lua translate_name
LuaHookMapToStorage /etc/lua/scripts/mapper.lua map
LuaOutputFilter ExampleFilter /etc/lua/scripts/filter.lua output_filter
</pre>

<p>With <kbd>LuaRoot</kbd> set, you can shorten these lines a bit:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-config">
LuaRoot /etc/lua/scripts/
LuaHookTranslateName translate.lua translate_name
LuaHookMapToStorage mapper.lua map
LuaOutputFilter ExampleFilter filter.lua output_filter
</pre>
